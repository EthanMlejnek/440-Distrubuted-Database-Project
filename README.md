# 440-Distrubuted-Database-Project
This repository is meant to contain all work related to my final project in CIS 440: Database Management Systems. 

## About this Project
The purpose of this project was to research, design, implement,  and deploy a distrubuted database for a global digital marketing agency with data centers located in the United States, Japan, and Argentina. To simulate this scenario we deployed three Ubuntu 22.04 headless server virtual machines meant to run as a MariaDB server cluster with full replication.  

### Working as a team of six, we accomplished the following project deliverables:
* Designed an ERD with over 30 entities adhering to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) or higher 
* Deployed a working MariaDB server cluster
* Implemented the database within the server cluster
* Populated the database with realistic mock data
* Wrote relevant reports that would be helpful in a real world scenario 
* Wrote stored procedures that would be helpful in a real world scenario
